# Input:
``` 
First line of the input contains dimensions of battle area having width and height
separated by space. Then the next line will have number (B) of battleships each player
has. Then in the next line battleship type, dimensions (width and height) & positions (Y
coordinate and X coordinate) for Player-1 and then for Player-2 will be given separated
by space. And then in the next line Player-1’s sequence (separated by space) of missiles
target location coordinates (Y and X) will be given and then for sequence for Player-2.
```

# Constraints:
```
1 <= Width of Battle area (M’) <= 9,
A <= Height of Battle area (N’) <= Z
1 <= Number of battleships <= M’ * N’
Type of ship = {‘P’, ‘Q’}
1 <= Width of battleship <= M’
A <= Height of battleship <= N’
1 <= X coordinate of ship <= M’
A <= Y coordinate of ship <= N’
